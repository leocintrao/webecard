Lottery system enabling a chain of sub-users

Is a Lottery website which encourages users to build their own chain of sub-users so that they can benefit from it. The website has many features such as;

Past results, Participants of the week, Total Number of members;
Full control of the E-Cards (lottery tickets) â€“ Identifying Winners, Actives, Draw dates and changes, Design, New E-Cards, E-Cards sales and give aways, and E-Cards printing page;
Full user's account control - Credit control, Usage history, Bonuses from chain, Account top up, User details and Withdrawal;
Users chain control - Views, Recommendation link;
E-Cards search and Registration;


This project has been created solely by me, from concept to code and design.

By using PHP together Codeigniter I have developed more than 70 methods (functions).
With Jquery, Photoshop, HTML and CSS I was able to deliver the whole product.

The website has yet only been partially translated to English from Portuguese. You may sign-in with user: leandro password: 121212
